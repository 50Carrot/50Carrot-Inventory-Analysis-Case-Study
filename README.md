## Overview
This repository contains a case study focused on inventory analysis for a medium-sized manufacturing company that produces electronic components. The goal of this analysis is to address inventory management challenges, including stockouts, excess inventory, and high carrying costs.

## Background
The company has a diverse product range and manages inventories of raw materials, work-in-progress (WIP), and finished goods. To improve efficiency and reduce costs, a thorough inventory analysis is conducted.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of the inventory analysis are:
- Determine optimal inventory levels for raw materials, WIP, and finished goods.
- Identify opportunities to reduce stockouts and excess inventory.
- Analyze inventory turnover and carrying costs to optimize working capital.
- Streamline procurement and production processes for enhanced efficiency.
- Develop a sustainable inventory management strategy for future growth.

## Data Available
The analysis utilizes the following datasets:
- **Inventory Records**: Detailed records of all inventory transactions, including purchases, production, sales, and adjustments.
- **Demand Data**: Historical sales data for different products.
- **Lead Time Data**: Information on the time required to receive raw materials and produce finished goods.
- **Cost Data**: Information on the costs associated with raw materials, production, and carrying.

## Tasks
To achieve the objectives, the following analyses will be conducted:
1. **Demand Forecasting**: Analyzing historical sales data to accurately forecast future product demand.
2. **ABC Analysis**: Classifying inventory items based on value and importance.
3. **Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) Analysis**: Determining optimal order quantities to minimize costs.
4. **Reorder Point Analysis**: Calculating reorder points for each product to prevent stockouts.
5. **Lead Time Analysis**: Assessing lead times for raw materials and production.
6. **Carrying Cost Analysis**: Identifying areas for cost reduction related to carrying inventory.
7. **Process Improvement**: Suggesting improvements to procurement and production processes.
8. **Inventory Turnover Analysis**: Calculating turnover ratios to assess inventory management efficiency.

## Deliverables
The analysis will result in:
- Recommendations for optimal inventory levels of raw materials, WIP, and finished goods.
- Reorder point and EOQ calculations for each product.
- Suggestions for streamlining procurement and production processes.
- An assessment of inventory turnover ratios with recommendations for improvement.
- A comprehensive inventory management strategy for the company.
